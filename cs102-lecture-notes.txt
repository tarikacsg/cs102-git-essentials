git add
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

git branch
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.

git clone
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

git commit
Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

git init
Initializes a new Git repository.
